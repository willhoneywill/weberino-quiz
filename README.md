# Weberino WordPress Quiz Plugin
WordPress Quiz is a WordPress plugin for adding a quiz to your WordPress website.
# Quiz format
Website owners are able to create 10 questions and the users will have three minutes to answer them. With the plugin you can
create as many quizzes as you like on any topic you want. 
You could also create a 'name that ten' style quiz, for example footballers who have scored in a World Cup finak, and instead 
of question there is a hint rather than a question.
